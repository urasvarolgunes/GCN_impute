## s&p500 stock dataset

Can directly use affMat.csv as the side information to fuse. 

It's calculated as the correlation matrix based on the stock daily return.

The stock set is the intersection of the raw stock price data and the stock names that appeared in the corpus. 

Be careful with the last dimension, since it's the labels telling which market sector a stock belongs.
